Description: This package implements our Pearson-Aitken family genetic risk scores (PA-FGRS). The method takes as input a relationship matrix and the disease status of relatives along with an estimate of the heritablity and (potentially stratified) information about life-time prevalence and age-specific cumulative incidence proportion. While modelling partially observed controls as a mixture of upper and lower truncated Gaussians, we use the Pearson-Aitken selection procedure to estimate the conditional expectation of the genetic liability.
